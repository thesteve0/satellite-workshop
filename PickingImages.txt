Show 3 things and going to be using a CPU (or Collab?)

1. Zero Shot Object detection with a CLIP-like model
2. Semantic Seg
3. Generating embeddings5555555

Big Question: 
Should I do multispectral or not


Dubai:
Pros
Small in size - 30 meg compressed
Already has masks
Not Multispectral
Could try a grounding object detection
High spatial resolution

Cons
Not Multispectral
Needs to be chipped
Probably about 400 Chips when finished


-----------------------------------

EuroSat - sent2
Pros
Multispectral
Georeferenced
Already chipped but only to 64x64
Pixel size 10m



Con
HUGE in size - definitely need to subset
Multispectral
Really just set up for classification - no masks or individual ground truth - explains why chipped to 64


-----------------------------------

Flair - toy dataset
Pros
Multispectral
512x512
Already broken into different train/test
Only 38 images in Train


Cons
Multispectral
NumPy arrays are stacks of images over a certain time frame and would need to be merged - contains clouds


-----------------------------------


Rainforest - sent2
Pros
Already in test train val
4 bands
512x512
Mask is just forest/not forest

Cons
1.1gig download

SEN12MS
